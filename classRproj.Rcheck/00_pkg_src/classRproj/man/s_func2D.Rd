\title{Creating a 2 Dimentional Sampling Function
This is a function to create a sample of the length n for a given joint pdf}
\usage{
s_func2D(n, jointpdf, a, b, C)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{is the number elements to be returned buy the function}

\item{jointpdf}{is the user give joint probability density function used to create the sample}

\item{a}{is the lower bound of the value of elements is the sample}

\item{b}{is the upper bound of the value of elements is the sample}

\item{C}{is >= to the max value of the  joint pdf}
}
\value{
a vector list of 2 by n sample that have been excepted as being valid according to joint pdf
of the interval (a, b)
}
